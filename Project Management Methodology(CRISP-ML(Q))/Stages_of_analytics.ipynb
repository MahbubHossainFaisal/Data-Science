It consists of six phases that provide a structured approach to guide the entire data mining project lifecycle. Here are the phases of CRISP-DM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business Understanding: This phase focuses on understanding the business objectives and requirements of the data mining project. It involves defining the problem, understanding the project goals, and determining how data mining can contribute to achieving those goals. Key tasks include identifying business objectives, assessing the situation, and formulating a data mining plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Understanding: In this phase, you explore and gain familiarity with the available data. You collect and analyze the data to understand its characteristics, quality, and relevance to the project. Key tasks include initial data collection, data description, data exploration, and data verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Preparation: This phase involves preparing the data for analysis. It includes tasks such as selecting relevant data, cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and addressing outliers. The goal is to ensure that the data is in a suitable format and quality for the modeling phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modeling: In this phase, you develop and build predictive or descriptive models based on the project goals. It includes selecting appropriate modeling techniques, creating the model, and validating it using training and testing datasets. The goal is to create accurate and reliable models that address the business objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluation: The evaluation phase focuses on assessing the performance and effectiveness of the models. It involves evaluating the models against the business objectives, measuring their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, and verifying if they meet the desired criteria. This phase helps determine whether the models are suitable for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deployment and Maintainance: The final phase involves deploying the models into the operational environment or integrating them into decision-making processes. This includes creating implementation plans, integrating the models with existing systems, and establishing procedures for monitoring and maintaining the models. The goal is to ensure that the models are effectively utilized to derive value and drive decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that CRISP-DM is an iterative process, meaning that after the deployment phase, the process can loop back to earlier phases if necessary. This allows for continuous improvement, refinement, and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle.\n",

For machine reliability, the success criterion may be the average time the machine operates without any issues. By using survival analytics and defining appropriate success criteria, we can better understand and assess the outcomes of events or processes.

    "Multithreading in Python is a programming technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single program. Threads are lightweight sub-processes that share the same memory space and can perform tasks independently. In other words, multithreading allows multiple functions or parts of a program to run at the same time, thereby improving the overall performance and efficiency of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is commonly used in Python for tasks such as network programming, web scraping, GUI development, and data processing. It can also be used for tasks that require parallel processing, such as image and video processing, scientific computing, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called \"threading\". The threading module provides a simple way to create and manage threads in Python. It allows you to create new threads, start and stop threads, and communicate between threads using synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables."

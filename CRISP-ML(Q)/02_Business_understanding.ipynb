    "**Business Problem**: A business problem is like when a store or a company has something that's not going well and needs to be fixed. For example, if a store has a lot of toys but no one is buying them, that's a problem because they want to sell the toys to make money.\n",

    "__Machine Learning Criteria:__ In a business, machine learning is like using special computer programs to help with important things. These programs can do clever things like understanding what customers like, predicting how much of a product will be needed, catching bad guys who try to cheat, and figuring out which customers might leave.\n",
    "To know if these machine learning programs are doing a good job, we use special rules called success criteria. These criteria help us check if the programs are accurate, helpful, and if they make the business better.\n",
    "For example, let's say we use machine learning to group customers into different groups based on what they like. We want to make sure the program does this correctly. So one success criterion is checking if the program gets the groups right most of the time.\n",
    "Another example is using machine learning to predict how much of a product will be needed in the future. We want the program to give us the right prediction, so another success criterion is checking if it predicts well most of the time.\n",
    "We also use machine learning to catch bad guys who try to cheat in the business. We want the program to find the cheaters and stop them. So a success criterion is checking if the program catches the bad guys and helps keep the business safe.\n",
    "Lastly, machine learning can help predict which customers might leave the business. We want to keep our customers happy, so we use the program to find out who might leave. A success criterion is checking if the program correctly predicts who might leave, so we can do something to keep them happy.\n",

    "__Survival Analytics:__ Survival analytics is a method used to study how long it takes for events to happen, such as patient survival or machine failure. In survival analytics, success criteria are based on the specific event being studied. For patient survival, the success criterion may be the percentage of patients who survive for a certain period of time after a treatment. For machine reliability, the success criterion may be the average time the machine operates without any issues. By using survival analytics and defining appropriate success criteria, we can better understand and assess the outcomes of events or processes. Survival analytics also checks the prediction model if it goes with the objectives and goals of the business. If the machine learning model any how hampering the financial growth, then survival analytics create constraints which has to be maintained along with the business objective while solving the business problem for the growth of the company.\n",

    "__Economic Success Criteria:__ Economic success criteria in business are about measuring how well a business is doing financially. It involves looking at factors like making money, creating jobs, and contributing to the overall growth of the economy. If a business is making more money than it spends, creating job opportunities for people, and helping the economy grow, it is considered economically successful. These criteria show that the business is financially strong and positively impacting the community or country it operates in."

    "__Let's consider a real-world example of a retail business__ that wants to improve its customer retention and increase sales through personalized marketing. Here are the details:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope of Application:\n",
    "- Business Problem: The retail business is facing challenges with customer retention. Many customers are leaving and not returning to make additional purchases.\n",
    "- Business Objective: The objective is to improve customer retention and increase sales by implementing personalized marketing strategies that cater to each customer's preferences and needs.\n",
    "- Business Constraints: The business has a limited budget for marketing initiatives, and there are regulations and privacy concerns that need to be followed when collecting and utilizing customer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Criteria:\n",
    "- Business Success Criteria: The business success criteria would include metrics such as increased customer retention rate, higher customer satisfaction scores, and growth in sales revenue from repeat customers.\n",
    "- Machine Learning Success Criteria: For machine learning to support personalized marketing, success criteria would involve the accuracy of the recommendation system, the ability to predict customer preferences and needs, and the effectiveness of targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "- Economic Success Criteria: Economic success criteria would be reflected in metrics like increased customer lifetime value, higher customer spending per visit, and improved overall profitability for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-World Example: Let's say the retail business implements a machine learning-based recommendation system that analyzes customer purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographic information. It then provides personalized product recommendations to each customer through email campaigns or on the business's website. The system also tracks customer responses to the recommendations and adjusts future recommendations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success criteria for this example could include:\n",
    "- Business Success Criteria: Increase customer retention rate by 20% within six months, achieve a 10% growth in sales revenue from repeat customers, and receive positive feedback from customers about the personalized shopping experience.\n",
    "- Machine Learning Success Criteria: Achieve an accuracy rate of 80% in predicting customer preferences, increase the click-through rate of personalized email campaigns by 15%, and receive positive feedback from customers regarding the relevance of the product recommendations.\n",
    "- Economic Success Criteria: Increase customer lifetime value by 15%, achieve a 10% increase in average customer spending per visit, and observe a positive impact on the overall profitability of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "By meeting these success criteria, the retail business would be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of its personalized marketing approach, improve customer retention, and ultimately drive economic success through increased sales and customer satisfaction."
